\section*{Introduction}

There is a great trend in grid management to use Deep Learning to optimize grid operations. there is also a trend In Deep learning to respect problem structure and constraints, such as equivariant neural networks and networks that respect inequalities. networks that respect problem structure and constraints have shown to learn more efficiently and achive better performance.
This paper proposes a new closed form way to make a neural network that solves the economic dispatch problem respect the problem constraints.
